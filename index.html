    <h1 style="text-align: center;">My First Web Page With Images</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Now I can display images:</p>
    <br>
    <center><img src="images/hello_world.png" alt="Hello, World!" width="500" height="266">
    </center>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I really like this class so far. It's been pretty fun learning the basics and I'm excited to see <br>where this course goes. I did add an image to the first web page, but this new way (adding <br>the image to a folder) is so much better! Additionally, I changed the size of the image using <br>the width and height tag, but I already learned that with the Hello World web page. I <br>also learned how to center an image, which I've wanted to do for a while now. This is <br>the website where I found out how to center the image, I'm hoping it is the correct way. </p>
